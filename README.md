# House Price Prediction
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  - You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. 
  - This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. 
- What is the background of your project?
  - Project belongs to finance sector and more specifically to Housing Industries. 
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
  - How well those variables describe the price of a house.
  - Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression. 
- What is the dataset that is being used?
  - Housing Prices collected for Australia 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- GrLivArea: Living area square feet above ground is the most important predictor
- Lasso Regression gives best performance with alpha=0.001 and RMSE=0.11
